// For this challenge, you will build a simulation of underpopulation, overpopulation, and
// reproduction called Conway's Game of Life (see https://mng.bz/xOyY). The simulation is played
// out on a two-dimensional grid of cells. As such, this challenge focuses on slices.

// Each cell has eight adjacent cells in the horizontal, vertical, and diagonal directions. In each
// generation, cells live or die based on the number of living neighbors.
