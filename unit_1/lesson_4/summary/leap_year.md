A year is a leap year if it is divisible by 4. However, if the year is divisible by 100, it is not a leap year unless it is also divisible by 400.

This table assumes that the year is already divisible by 4.

| Divisible by 100 | Divisible by 400 | Is Leap Year |
| ---------------- | ---------------- | ------------ |
| True             | True             | True         |
| True             | False            | False        |
| False            | True             | True         |
| False            | False            | True         |
